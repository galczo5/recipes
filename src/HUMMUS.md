# Hummus 

I have decided to create this file because after testing few recipes from the internet,
I still had problems getting the best possible hummus.

A lot of ingredients you have to adjust during the cooking, but there are some proportions you can follow.

By weight:
- 100g of dried chickpeas
- 50g of tahini - probably may change, depends on the tahini you have
- 1 lemon
- 1 teaspoon of baking soda
- 1 clove of garlic (split and remove the core)
- olive oil
- salt
- ground cumin
- very cold water (if you can, ice water)

Recipe:
- Soak the chickpeas for a few hours in a fridge - (8-12h)
- Remove water from the container, leave chickpeas to dry for a few minutes
- Place chickpeas in the pot with baking soda but without water. Fry it for 3-5min.
- Transfer your chickpeas to big bowl with a lot of water. Rub them against each other. This action should allow you to remove chickpea skins. I had to change the water a few times.
- Boil the chickpeas (30-40min). You should end with a little overcooked chickpeas.
- Remove the water and let it cool down (30-45min)
- Put beans and garlic in the kitchen robot (or standing mixer) and let it cut everything into very small pieces.
- Add tahini and lemon juice to the kitchen robot and mix it well
- Add salt, cumin and olive oil to a taste. For 100g of beans I've added about 30-50g of olive oil. Salt and cumin should be added pinch after pinch to get the taste you like. If you need more lemon, add it now.
- With a kitchen robot turned on add a few tablespoons of cold water. After every spoon, stop the robot, check the consistency of the hummus.
