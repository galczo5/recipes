# Limoncello
Italian lemon liqueur mainly produced in Southern Italy, especially in the region around the Gulf of Naples, the Sorrentine Peninsula and the coast of Amalfi, and islands of Procida, Ischia, and Capri.


## Ingredients
* 3 Lemons (as bio as possible)
* 250ml of Pure Spirit 95% alcohol
* 250g of sugar (please use white sugar, I've tried it with brown, taste is good, but you will get better color with white one)
* 750ml of filtered water


## Recipe
1. Wash your lemons using clear water.
2. Peel lemons very finely, peelings should contain only yellow part of lemon skin. **Use vegetable peeler for best result.**
3. Fill glass jar with alcohol, put there your peelings, cover it and leave it for minimum 3 days in cold dark place. Fridge was the best place for me.
4. When alcohol is ready, disolve sugar in water.
5. Add filtered alcohol to water and sugar mix. **Now color should change to nice very light non-transparent green.**
6. Pour limoncello into glass bottles, close it and leave it in cold and dark place for few days.
7. Serve it very cold.
